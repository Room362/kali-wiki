### Live Online Copy: http://room362.github.io/kali-wiki

You can find a copy of the project online at: 
### Offline Use:

  1. Clone the repository or pull the archive ([download zip](https://github.com/room362/kali-wiki/archive/master.zip)) of the repo
  2. Open index.html
  3. Most modern browsers don't allow the access of local files from a locally loaded HTML file. On Windows you can use [Mongoose Tiny](http://cesanta.com/downloads.html) or [HFS](http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/) to host the files locally. On OSX and Linux `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` seems to work just fine.
